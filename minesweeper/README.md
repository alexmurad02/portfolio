# Minesweeper Game (C++ with SFML)

This project is a graphical implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game, developed as a class assignment using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

## Overview

The game uses SFML to create a graphical interface that allows users to interact with a Minesweeper board through mouse input. Core features include tile revealing, flag placement, win/loss detection, and a clean visual layout (dependent on external resources not included here).

## Project Structure

- "main.cpp" – Handles the game loop and SFML window
- "Board.cpp" & "Board.h" – Manages board state and game logic
- "Tile.cpp" & "Tile.h" – Manages individual tile behavior
- "README.md" – Project overview

## Notes

- The project depends on image and font resources that are not included in this repository.
- Without these resources, the application will not compile or run as intended.
- This code is provided for educational reference.
